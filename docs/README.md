Welcome to the Rust Guide! This guide has been written for students who have 
prior programming experience and want to learn Rust. The contents are designed 
to serve as a rapid introduction for students taking 
[CMSC235/335 - Introduction to Database Systems](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/55320) 
at the University of Chicago. It is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions 
from the community.
