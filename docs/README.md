# Rust Guide

Welcome to the Rust Guide! This guide has been written for students who have 
prior programming experience and want to learn Rust. The contents are designed 
to serve as a rapid introduction for students taking 
[CMSC235/335 - Introduction to Database Systems](https://classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2023/spring/23500-1/) 
at the University of Chicago. It is a work in progress, and we welcome contributions 
from the community.
