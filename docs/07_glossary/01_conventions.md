# Conventions

Here is some basic information on some notation used throughout the book.

## Additional information boxes


Throughout the book, you will encounter four types of information boxes:

:::{note} Technical Details
This kind of box provides deeper technical details about something
that was just explained. These technical details are not essential to
understanding the concept or skill that precedes this box and are
mostly provided for readers who want to dig a bit deeper (especially if you're 
the kind of learner who has an easier time understanding new
concepts with those lower-level details).

This means that you can usually safely skip these boxes on your first
read through a chapter. However, if you do so, we still recommend
revisiting these boxes once you become more comfortable with the material.
:::

:::{warning} Common Pitfalls
This kind of box alerts you to common pitfalls that beginners sometimes
make. Make sure to read this box so you don't fall into those pitfalls yourself!
:::

:::{tip} Debugging Tips
As we'll describe later in the book, debugging issues in your code can sometimes
feel like solving a murder mystery where you are both the detective and the murderer.
Pinpointing the cause of errors in your code is a skill that takes time to
build, so we've made sure to include debugging tips throughout the book so
you know what to look out for when your code fails in certain ways.
:::

:::{hint} Note

   Notes are used to clarify certain concepts or to call out information that doesn't
   fit into any of the above boxes.

<!-- ## Special sections

Sometimes, entire sections of the book will revolve around the kind of technical
details we would include in a Technical Details box (as described above). Look out for sections with the gears icon like this:



When you see a section like this, remember that you can safely skip it
if you want to, but may want to revisit it later on. -->
